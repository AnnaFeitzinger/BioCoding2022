## Lesson

There are a number of reasons why accessing a remote machine is invaluable to any scientists working with large datasets. In the early history of computing, working on a remote machine was standard practice - computers were bulky and expensive. Today we work on laptops that are more powerful than the sum of the world's computing capacity 20 years ago, but many analyses (especially in genomics) won't work on these laptops and must be run on remote machines. 

You'll know you need to start working on the cloud when...

- Your computer does not have enough resources to run the desired analysis (memory, processors, disk space, network bandwidth).
- Your computer is taking hours or days to get through an analysis.
- You cannot install software on your computer (application does not have support for your operating system, conflicts with other existing applications, etc.)

The cloud is a part of our everyday life (e.g. using Amazon, Google, Netflix, or an ATM involves remote computing). The topic is fascinating but this lesson says '5 minutes or less' so let's get connected. 

## Exercises

### **A. Connecting to a remote machine via SSH**

This is the first and last place in these lessons where it will matter if you are using PC, Mac, or Linux. After we connect, we will all be on the same operating system/computing environment. 

> To save time, your instructor will have launched an remote computer (instance) for you prior to the workshop. If you are following these lessons on your own, or after the workshop see the lesson on [launching cloud instances on your own](https://jasonjwilliamsny.github.io/cloud-genomics/logging-onto-cloud.html) for instructions on how to do this yourself. 

**User Credentials**
Credentials are case sensitive:

- Username: dcuser
- Password: data4Carp

#### **Connecting using PC**<br>
*Prerequisites*: You must have an SSH client. There are several free options and we will use PuTTY [[Download Putty.exe](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)]

1. Open PuTTY; In the 'Host Name (or IP address)' section paste in the IP address provided by your instructor (or the ip address of an instance you have provisioned yourself). *Keep the default selection 'SSH' and Port (22)*. <br>
<p><img src="./img/putty_screenshot_1.png"width="500"></p>
2. Click 'Open' and you will be presented with a security warning. Select 'Yes' to continue to connect. <br>
<p><img src="./img/putty_screenshot_2.png"width="500"></p>
3. In the final step, you will be asked to provide a login and password. **Note:** When typing your password, it is common in Unix/Linux not see see any asterisks (e.g. ****) or moving cursors. Just continue typing.<br> 
<p><img src="./img/putty_screenshot_3.png"width="500"></p>
4. You should now be connected!

---

#### **Connecting using Mac/Linux**<br>
*Prerequisites*: Mac and Linux operating systems will already have terminals installed. Simply search for 'Terminal' and/or look for the terminal icon.<br> 
![terminal icon](./img/terminal.png)


1. open the terminal and type the following command substituting 'ip_address' for the ip address your instructor will provide (or the ip address of an instance you have provisioned yourself). *Be sure to pay attention to capitalization and spaces*

        $ ssh dcuser@ip_address
        
2. You will receive a security message that looks something like the message below. Type 'yes' to proceed.

        The authenticity of host 'ec2-52-91-14-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com (52.91.14.206)' can't be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:S2mMV8mCThjJHm0sUmK2iOE5DBqs8HiJr6pL3x/XxkI. Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

3. In the final step, you will be asked to provide a login and password. **Note:** When typing your password, it is common in Unix/Linux not see see any asterisks (e.g. ****) or moving cursors. Just continue typing.
4. You should now be connected!


### **B. Connecting to a remote machine via VNC** 
[VNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) - Virtual Network Computing is a technology that allows you to connect to and share the desktop of a remote computer. To use VNC the computer you are connecting to must be running a VNC server. To view the desktop, you will need to download a VNC viewing client such as RealVNCs [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/). 

1. To start the VNC server on your remote computer enter the command:
```
$ vncstart
```
2. Open [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/); enter the same IP address you used to connect to the remote computer via SSH **+ ':1'** (e.g. ec2-11-11-111-11.compute-1.amazonaws.com:1)
3. Confirm you wish to connect to the instance (you may need to say yes to confirm the first time you connect to a new instance, and/or if the connection is unencrypted). Enter your username (dcuser) and password. 
4. You should now be viewing the desktop of your instance.

### **C. Verifying your connection and environment** 

When you connect, it is typical to receive a welcome screen. The Data Carpentry Amazon instances display this message upon connecting:

```bash
Welcome to Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-48-generic x86_64)

You should also have a blinking cursor awaiting your command

```bash
dcuser@ip-172-31-62-209 ~ $
```

## Bonus material

Now that we have connected we can move on to the Unix shell lesson. There are however a few commands that tell you a little about the machine you have connected to:

- `whoami` - shows your username on computer you have connected to:

```bash
dcuser@ip-172-31-62-209 ~ $ whoami
dcuser
```
-  `df -h` - shows space on hard drive* 

```bash
dcuser@ip-172-31-62-209 ~ $ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            2.0G   12K  2.0G   1% /dev
tmpfs           396M  792K  395M   1% /run
/dev/xvda1       99G   48G   47G  51% /
none            4.0K     0  4.0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
none            5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock

none            100M   36K  100M   1% /run/user
```
\* Under the column 'Mounted on' row that has '/' as the value shows the value for the main disk. 

- `cat /proc/cpuinfo` - shows detail information on how many processors (CPUs) the machine has

## Staying Connected to the Cloud

Depending on how you connect to the cloud, you may have processes and jobs that are running, and will need to continue running for sometime. If you have collected to your cloud desktop via VNC, jobs you start will continue to run. If you are connecting via SSH, if you end the SSH connection (e.g. you exit your SSH session, you loose your connection to the internet, you close your laptop, etc.), jobs that are still running when you disconnect. There are a few ways to keep cloud processes running in the background. Many times when we refer to a background process we are talking about what is [described at this tutorial](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-command-line-run-in-background/) - running a command and returning to shell prompt. Here we describe a program that will allow us to run our entire shell and keep that process running even if we disconnect: `tmux`. 

### Starting and attaching to `tmux` sessions

**Starting a new session**

A 'session' can be thought of as a window for `tmux`, you might open an terminal to do one thing on the a computer and then open a new terminal to work on another task at the command line. You can start a session and give it a descriptive name:

```bash
    $ tmux new -s session_name
``` 
This creates a session with the name 'session_name'

As you work, this session will stay active until you close this session. Even if you disconnect from your machine, the jobs you start in this session will run till completion. 

**Seeing active sessions**

If you disconnect from your session, or from your ssh into a machine, you will need to reconnect to an existing `tmux` session. You can see a list of existing sessions:

```bash
$ tmux list-sessions
```

**Connecting to a session**

To connect to an existing session:

```bash
$ tmux attach -t session_name
# -t option = 'target'
```

**Switch sessions**
You can switch between sessions:

```bash
$ tmux switch -t session_name
```

**Kill a session**
You can end sessions:

```bash
$ tmux kill-session -t session_name
```
